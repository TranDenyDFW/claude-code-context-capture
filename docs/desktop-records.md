# How the desktop app addresses a session

The requirement is that an imported project SHOWS UP IN THE DESKTOP APP. That turns on two
questions this file answers with evidence rather than assumption: where a record has to be written,
and whether writing the file is enough.

## 1. The path is `<account uuid>/<org uuid>/local_<uuid>.json`, and both uuids are the MACHINE's

    %APPDATA%\Claude\claude-code-sessions\<account>\<org>\local_<desktop session uuid>.json

Counted on this machine: 184 `local_*.json` records plus 9 `scheduled-tasks.json`, every one of
them at exactly that depth.

The two directory levels are NOT per project. One pair holds 171 records covering 57 distinct
working directories, and 6 working directories appear under two different pairs, so a pair cannot
be derived from a cwd. They were identified by finding the same uuids named elsewhere:

| Level | What it is | Where it is named |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | account uuid | `config.json` key `lastKnownAccountUuid`, and the top-level keys of `ant-device-registry.json` |
| 2 | organisation uuid | `plan-usage-history.json` samples, field `org` |

**This is the finding that makes or breaks the feature.** An import that reproduces the source
machine's relative path files the record under a FOREIGN account uuid, where the destination app
never looks. So the record's relative path is carried as the FILENAME ONLY, and the account and
org directories are resolved on the importing machine.

Three sources agree on which pair is active here, which is why the resolver cross-checks them
rather than trusting one:

    config.json lastKnownAccountUuid      54e8e2c2-...
    newest plan-usage-history org sample  5f6eb959-...
    newest local_*.json on disk           54e8e2c2-... / 5f6eb959-...   2026-09-09T00:49:49

The runner-up pair on disk is 12 days stale (`ba7ccf25-.../2108d9a2-...`, 2026-08-28), so the
disk answer is decisive here rather than a coin toss. When a destination has no records at all,
there is no evidence and the resolver REPORTS that instead of guessing a directory the app will
ignore.

## 2. The directory is the list. There is no index to also update

Measured against the app's `Local Storage/leveldb`, read as raw bytes:

    desktop session ids present in Local Storage : 33 of 184
    working directories present                  :  0 of 59

151 sessions the app lists are absent from Local Storage, and no working directory appears there
at all, so Local Storage is UI state and not the session list. The record files are what the app
enumerates. That is what makes a file-level import sufficient, and it is checked for real rather
than argued: verification step 7 opens the imported project in the desktop app on LT.

## 3. What a record carries

Top-level fields: `cliSessionId` (which is c4x's `session_id`), `sessionId` (`local_<uuid>`, the
desktop namespace, and the filename), `cwd`, `originCwd`, `isArchived`, `title`, `createdAt`,
`lastActivityAt`, `completedTurns`, `model`, `permissionMode`, plus MCP and permission settings.

`cwd` and `originCwd` are the only fields that name the source machine's filesystem, so they are
the only two an import rewrites. Everything else is carried byte for byte.

## 4. The config entry, for completeness

`~/.claude.json` `projects[<cwd>]` holds `hasTrustDialogAccepted`,
`hasClaudeMdExternalIncludesApproved`, `hasClaudeMdExternalIncludesWarningShown`, `allowedTools`,
`enabledMcpjsonServers`, `disabledMcpjsonServers`, `mcpContextUris`. No value inside is a
filesystem path, so only the KEY is rebased. `hasTrustDialogAccepted` is why an imported project
otherwise asks to be trusted again on first open.
